        Thanks for your patronage.<br><br>Our refund policy is such that, every client who is displeased with our services
        may request for a refund. The money will be refunded to the original payment method you&apos;ve used during the purchase.
        For debit/credit card payments it may take 2 to 5 business days for a refund to show up on your card statement. The
        client would be required to provide a bank account into which the initial sum received by us will be credited. Bank
        charges would also be deducted from the initial sum.
        <br><br>If anything is unclear or you have more questions feel free
        to contact our customer support team.
